# Lua GDExtension Sandbox
This project is a fork of [lua-gdextension](https://github.com/gilzoide/lua-gdextension) focused on providing an improved and safer sandboxed Lua environment.

Currently, the extension still contains several legacy features from the original project, including the option to use Lua instead of GDScript, but these will be removed in future releases.

# Getting started
Check the [wiki](https://github.com/MickTK/lua-gdextension/wiki) for more informations.

# Build
Simply run `scons` in the root folder.

For more informations visit: [Godot Engine - Compiling the plugin](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/cpp/gdextension_cpp_example.html#compiling-the-plugin).

# Releases
As in the original repository, builds are automated and can be found in the [Actions](https://github.com/MickTK/lua-gdextension/actions/workflows/build.yml) section.

If you encounter any issues, you can follow these [instructions](https://github.com/gilzoide/lua-gdextension/discussions/15). Make sure to download the extension from this repository.
